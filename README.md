MERN App Template 💻
</h1>
</div>

---

### Project Starter 🚀

A basic MERN app template, with a RESTful API and full CRUD functionality for a user database.

---

### Info 🤓

<br>

Template includes:

> 1.  React with Vite configuration
> 2.  ESLint and Prettier (airbnb)
> 3.  React Router
> 4.  Template frontend file structure
> 5.  Template CSS file structure with generic variables (not setup with a library in mind)
> 6.  Template server file structure with example API for a user database
> 7.  JWT, bcrypt, CORS and auth middleware
> 8.  .env template file which includes the variables you need to fill in with your info

Project includes notes in the backend files to briefly explain what the code is doing

Note: _you will need to create a MongoDB database collection, and input info into the .env file provided. You will also need ESLint and Prettier installed as extensions in VSCode._

### API endpoints

| Functionality     | Route               | HTTP Method | Protected? |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Get users         | /api/users          | GET         | Y          |
| Get user by id    | /api/users/me       | GET         | Y          |
| Update user by id | /api/users/:id      | PUT         | Y          |
| Delete user by id | /api/users/:id      | DELETE      | Y          |
| Register user     | /api/users/register | POST        | N          |
| Login user        | /api/users/login    | POST        | N          |

Any protected routes require a JWT bearer token in the HTTP request header.
